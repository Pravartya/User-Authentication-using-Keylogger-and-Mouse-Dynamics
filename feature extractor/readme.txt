Guidelines:

1. Keep the 'feature extractor' folder along with 'keylogger'  folder. (i.e Keep them in same parent folder)
2.    Execute 'feature_extractor.exe' in 'feature extractor' folder. 
     This will create a folder 'preproc_data' containing hold time and latencies for all combination of keystrokes.
